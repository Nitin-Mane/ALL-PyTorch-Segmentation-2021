# Introduction
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a cancer of the lymphoid line of blood cells characterized by the development of large numbers of immature lymphocytes. Symptoms may include feeling tired, pale skin color, fever, easy bleeding or bruising, enlarged lymph nodes, or bone pain. As an acute leukemia, ALL progresses rapidly and is typically fatal within weeks or months if left untreated.
ALL is typically treated initially with chemotherapy aimed at bringing about remission. This is then followed by further chemotherapy typically over a number of years. Treatment usually also include intrathecal chemotherapy since systemic chemotherapy can have limited penetration into the central nervous system and the central nervous system is a common site for relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

## Network Architecture

&nbsp;

# Installation
First you need to install the required software for training the model. Below are the available installation guides:

- [Ubuntu installation guide](installation/ubuntu.md) (Training).

# Data

## Application testing data

&nbsp;

# Configuration
[configuration/config.json](../configuration/config.json "configuration/config.json")  holds the configuration for our application.

- Change **agent->cores** to the number of cores you have on your training computer.
